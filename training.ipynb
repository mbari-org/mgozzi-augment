    "# Training the Deepsea Network\n",
    "This project incorporates wandb directly inside the YOLOv5 network (wandb support was added by ultralytics). This notebook allows us to retrain the model and see how train time augmentations can improve the networks ability to detect and track objects without increasing the data sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "Training using the ml.p3.2xlarge is about 10x faster ml.t3.medium which makes the p3 more cost effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Known Issues\n",
    "When running the training script in quick succession on the g4dn.xlarge, a memory issue may arise. Shut down the running instance and wait for the machine to become available again and restart the program. This seems to be an issue related to YOLOv5 and Sagemaker's use of a RAM partition as \"storage.\""
